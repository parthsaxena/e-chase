<h1>E-chase</h1>
E-chase uses the UberX model to deliver any good from any nearby store. 

<h2>How?</h2>
We use a collection of shopping API's including Goodzer, Google's API, and more in addition to a web-crawler built to scrape inventory information from leading merchants.

<h2>Why?</h2>
E-chase doesn't depend on partnerships with individual merchants, rather it can expand by itself to new stores by consuming merchant data from the web.
